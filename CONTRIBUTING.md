# Contributing

At *Statusify*, contributions are always welcome. We're open to all sorts of changes, big or small, as long as they affect the project positively. Statusify is built by people like *you*, that's the beauty of open-source software.

## How to contribute?

If you have some change in mind for the project, begin by forking it. Clone it to your local machine, make the changes you want, push and *create a pull request*. We'll look into it as soon as possible, and make our best efforts to merge it. If you find a problem, just create an *issue* and it'll be resolved before you know it.

## Code guidelines and stuff.

We don't have too strict code guidelines yet, but here are the things you should keep in mind.

1. Try to follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).
2. Write **tests** when you add a new feature. The last thing you want going down is your status page.
3. Mark pull requests *WIP* if you don't want someone to merge them at the moment.
4. Add `[ci skip]` to commit messages if they are just mere documentation changes. We don't want to load up the good guys at Travis CI with nothing.
5. Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ur0/statusify/blob/development/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).
